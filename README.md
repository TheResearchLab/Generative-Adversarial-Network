# Generative-Adversarial-Network

GANs are a type of Neural Network structure that is popular for the case of synthetic data generation. GANs consists of a generator and discriminator where the generator produces the synthetic data and the discriminator classifies real data from synthetic data. This methodology has been cited in art, 3d modeling, finance, and can overall be a very useful tool for modelers in generating synthetic data that can help expand a dataset.

# Projects
These are the projects included in this repo utilizing GANs. The projects are introductory explorations with commentary to explore different data preparatory and modeling techniques. 

## Project-1 (CAT-GAN)
This implementation is based on the Kaggle cat face dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models). The purpose of this project is for generating cat faces.
